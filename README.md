### 👋 Hi! I'm Mykyta.

<br>

📍 Locations<br>
- Until 2017: Ukraine 🇺🇦
- 2017 – 2024: Lisbon, Portugal 🇵🇹

👨🏻‍🎨 From 2010 to 2022, I worked professionally as a [2D Artist](https://www.artstation.com/mykytaso). 

<br>


🎓 I’ve always been passionate about technology, and in 2023, I enrolled in `CS50: Introduction to Computer Science` (an amazing course offered by Harvard University), which I successfully completed.

- [CS50 Certificate.](https://certificates.cs50.io/5227e606-8e1c-4164-8718-4c6ec16057a4.pdf?size=letter)

<br>

🎓 `CS50` made me realize there is no turning back—I need to change my career. In late 2023, I enrolled in the Python Developer course at `Mate Academy`.

Here are some of my projects from the course:
- [API service for Library management (with Payments and Telegram bot notifications).](https://github.com/mykytaso/library-service) 
- [API service for Airport management.](https://github.com/mykytaso/airport-api-service)
- [IT Company Task Manager.](https://github.com/mykytaso/it-company-task-manager)
