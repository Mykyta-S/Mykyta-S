🇺🇦 Hi! I'm Mykyta from Ukraine

🇵🇹 Since 2017, I have been living in Lisbon, Portugal

🎨 Since 2010, I've been working professionally as a 2D Artist. You can check out my works on <a href="https://www.artstation.com/mykyta_soloviov">ArtStation</a>

🤖 I've always been passionate about technology. In 2023, I enrolled in "CS50: Introduction to Computer Science," a fantastic course offered by Harvard University, and I successfully completed it!

📽️ You can watch the demo of my Final Project on <a href="https://youtu.be/IIwnNInCA_8">Youtube</a>

💾 The project itself is available in my <a href="https://github.com/mykyta-so/CS50">CS50 repository</a>

🎓 At the end of 2023, I enrolled in the Python Developer course at <a href="https://mate.academy/en">Mate Academy</a>
