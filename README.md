👾 Since 2010, I’ve been working professionally as a [2D Artist](https://www.artstation.com/mykyta_so), but I've always been passionate about technology. In 2023, I enrolled in `CS50: Introduction to Computer Science`, an amazing course offered by Harvard University, and I successfully completed it.

- [CS50 Certificate.](https://certificates.cs50.io/5227e606-8e1c-4164-8718-4c6ec16057a4.pdf?size=letter)

<br>

🎓 After finishing `CS50`, I realized there is no turning back – I need to change my profession. So, at the end of 2023, I enrolled in the Python Developer course at  [Mate Academy](https://mate.academy/en).

Here are some of my projects from the course:
- [API service for Library management (with Payments and Telegram bot notifications).](https://github.com/mykyta-so/library-service) 
- [API service for Airport management.](https://github.com/mykyta-so/airport-api-service)
- [IT Company Task Manager.](https://github.com/mykyta-so/it-company-task-manager)
