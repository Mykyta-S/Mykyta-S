🇺🇦 Hi! I'm Mykyta from Ukraine

🇵🇹 Temporarily, I live in Lisbon, Portugal

🎨 Since 2010, I've been working professionally as a 2D Artist. You can check out my works on <a href="https://www.artstation.com/mykyta_soloviov">ArtStation</a>

🤖 I always had a passion for Tech and in 2023 I decided to enroll in <i>CS50: Introduction to Computer Science,</i> a fantastic course from Harvard University, and I successfully completed it!

📽️ You can watch the demo of my Final Project on <a href="https://youtu.be/IIwnNInCA_8">Youtube</a>

💾 The project itself is available in my <a href="https://github.com/mykyta-so/CS50">CS50 repository</a>
